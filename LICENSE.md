**This project, as much as it represents my work, is a rough prototype and the result of an education. Please feel free to use any or all of my code and assets in any way you see fit, including for commercial projects. I don't insist that you credit me in your derivative work, but it would be interesting to see what you produce; if you so wish, I can be contacted by [email](mailto:rob@bonfiredog.co.uk_).**

This project was based on the [*Make A Game With No Experience*](http://www.pentadact.com/2015-01-09-video-tutorial-make-a-game-with-no-experience/) video tutorial series by [Tom Francis](http://pentadact.com), aka Pentadact. I don't believe that I have directly used any of his assets or code; only his spoken guidance in the videos. However, if you do find any code or assets which are not mine in this project, please be advised that their liensing is the purview of Tom Francis; having said this, he doesn't seem to apply any stricture at all. 

The sounds were generated using [bfxr](http://bfxr.net), by the mystic [increpare](http://increpare.net), which thankfully has this to say about his tool: *"You have full rights to all sounds made with bfxr, and are free to use them for any purposes, commercial or otherwise."* That's lovely!

In order to decompile this game you will need [Gamemaker: Studio](http://yoyogames.com), which is a commercial product by Yoyo Games Ltd. Any licensing terms will be found either within the software itself or on the [website](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio).
