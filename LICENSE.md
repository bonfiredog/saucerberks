*Saucerberks* Project Licence Agreement v1.0
================================

**This project, as much as it represents my work, is a rough prototype and the result of an auto-didactic process. I'm happy for you to use any or all of my code, writing and assets from this project in any way you see fit, including for commercial purposes. I don't insist that you credit me in your derivative work, but it would be interesting to see what you are working on.; if you so wish, I can be contacted by [email](mailto:rob@bonfiredog.co.uk_).** 

This assurance translates into a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, which is a [Free Culture](https://creativecommons.org/freeworks/) license as well.

This project was based on the [*Make A Game With No Experience*](http://www.pentadact.com/2015-01-09-video-tutorial-make-a-game-with-no-experience/) video tutorial series by [Tom Francis](http://pentadact.com), a.k.a **Pentadact**. I don't believe that I have directly used any of his assets or code, only his spoken guidance in the videos. However, if you do find any code or assets which are not mine in this project, please be advised that their licensing is the purview of Tom Francis; having said this, he doesn't seem to apply any stricture at all. 

The sounds in *Saucerberks* were generated using [bfxr](http://bfxr.net), a tool authored by the mystic [increpare](http://increpare.net). Thankfully, *"you have full rights to all sounds made with bfxr, and are free to use them for any purposes, commercial or otherwise."* Oh, good!

In order to decompile this game you will need [Gamemaker: Studio](http://yoyogames.com), which is a commercial product by Yoyo Games. Any licensing terms relating to that software will be found either within the program itself or on the [website](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio).
