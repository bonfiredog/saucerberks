#Saucerberks
*A scrappy game for PC & Mac that I made to learn how to code properly. Concerning the shooting of aliens, with a thin veneer of pathos.*

**Download Latest PC Version:**&nbsp;&nbsp;[`.exe`](http://bonfiredog.co.uk)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[`installer`](http://bonfiredog.co.uk)

**Download Latest Mac Version:**&nbsp;&nbsp;[`application`](http://bonfiredog.co.uk)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[`.dmg`](http://bonfiredog.co.uk)

###How To Play

  * You are a Saucerberk, some sort of commissioned official in a spaceship. I'm not sure who commissioned you, who built your ship, or where you come from. All I know is that you are tasked with *maintaining the sites of past battles, collisions and other disasters*. These dangerous sectors of space are littered with the debris and rubble, but your most fearsome foe are the aliens that infest these sites. By their very presence they sully the memories of those who died! You must destroy them at all costs and restore the sanctity of these sacred sites!

  * First of all, get yourself a physical, honest-to-a-god *mouse*. Not only is it, pleasingly, the same shape as your spaceship, it will make the game far more enjoyable. You can play it with a trackpad, but I make no apologies for how unpleasant an experience that will be.
  
  * Your ship has two weapons; a rapid fire blaster and a 'bait gun', fired with the left and right mouse buttons respectively. The `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` buttons move your ship around each debris field, and the mouse turns the ship to face a particular direction.
  
  * The field is cleared, and the level completed, when you have destroyed every alien within it. You have three lives before you must start again, though your highest 'streak' is always remembered by the game. 
  
  *There are two types of alien. The red aliens can be destroyed with the blaster, but they will hunt the spaceship if they see it. They also will continue to appear from out of the debris field, infinitely, until you have killed all of the green aliens. Make what you will of that relationship. Once all of the green aliens are dead, the red aliens will stop respawning, and you can clear the field.

  * The green aliens, indifferent to your presence, cannot be killed with the blaster until they have swallowed at least one red alien. Using the bait gun, you must lure the green aliens to swallow red aliens, which will grow it in size. It is then vulnerable to the blaster, and explosive bursting. The more red aliens it swallows, the larger the eventual burst will be.  
  
  * Be careful in the debris fields; there are other dangers amongst the flying shards of metal and drifting ruins than aliens, though perhaps you will find other tools to aid you, as well...

###Development

The game evolved from a tutorial game I made in 2015, following the video series [*How To Make A Game With No Experience*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN6dZWXUEzA) by [Tom Francis](http://pentadact.com), the developer of [*Gunpoint*](http://www.gunpointgame.com/). It is a calm, well-structured introduction to actually building the half-chaotic, headlong house of sticky cards that is a videogame, and by the end of it I understood a lot more about conditional logic, dependencies, trigonometry and debugging, amongst a million other things. After the tutorial series finished I added other features tentatively, puzzling out each technique as I went, as well as changing the aesthetic quite substantially.

###Tools Used

  * [Gamemaker: Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio)
  * [bfxr.net](http://bfxr.net)
  * MS Paint

###License
This game was a means to an end. I improved my coding abilities, and in the end had something in which people could drift around. As such, I have no desire to license it or restrict its use or dissection in any way, shape or form; please do whatever you want with it. If you own **Gamemaker: Studio**, you can open the .gmx project file and play around with the code directly; I have commented it fairly rigourously. 

For more details, see the [`License.MD`](https://github.com/bonfiredog/saucerberks/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file in the repository.

###System Requirements
I'm fairly certain that the game should run on any Windows PC or Mac built in the last five or six years. However, if you have any performance problems, please see the *Bugs* section below.

###Bugs
If you experience any issues of performances, crashes, odd behaviour or the like, *please* do send me a bug report [via email](mailto:admin@bonfiredog.co.uk) with as much detail as you can manage. It really helps me to improve.
