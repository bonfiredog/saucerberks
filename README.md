#Saucerberks
*A 2D shooting game for PC & Mac that I made in order to learn how to code properly. It concerns the shooting of aliens, with an additional, translucent veneer of pathos.*

You are a **Saucerberk**, some sort of commissioned official in a lime-green spaceship. I'm not sure what that regalia represents, or who commissioned you officially. Your job is to **maintain those sectors of space where great battles, awful disasters and interstellar wrecks occurred**. These dangerous zones of open vacuum are littered with debris from these past tragedies. Your most important foe, however, is not momentum, entropy or jagged hunks of floating steel, but instead the **alien creatures that infest these sites**. These are sacred places, memorials to those who died, and the presence of these aliens desecrates those memories. You must **get rid of them at all costs**.<br /><br />

###How To Play

 * First of all, get yourself a physical, honest-to-a-god *mouse*. Not only is it, pleasingly, the same shape as your spaceship, it will make the game far more playable. You can play with a trackpad, but I make no apologies for how unpleasant an experience that will be.
 
 * `W` `A` `S` `D` - Move The Ship
 
 * `Left Mouse` - Rapid Fire Blaster
 
 * `Right Mouse` - Pheromone Gun
 
 *  `Mouse` - Turn Ship
   
 * Each level takes place at a different memorial site: the level is completed when every alien is destroyed. You have three lives.
 
 * There are two types of alien infesting the wrecks: at the risk of exposing the design, let's call these the Vandal and the Glutton. The swarming Vandals, which are antagonistic to the Saucerberk, can be easily destroyed by the blaster. However, the Glutton cannot be harmed until it has swallowed at least one Vandal. The only way to do this is to use the Pheromone Gun to lay a trail of delicious chemicals to a Vandal, inducing the Glutton to swallow it and become vulnerable to the blaster, and explosive bursting. The more Vandals are swallowed, the larger the burst will be.
 
 * Until all the Gluttons are dead, more and more Vandals will be drawn to the level. 
 
 * The debris fields holds other hazards and boons as well, but discovering is all part of the frantic, hyperventilated fun of being a Saucerberk.

###Development

The game emerged from a tutorial video series which I followed in 2015, called [*How To Make A Game With No Experience*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN6dZWXUEzA) by [Tom Francis](http://pentadact.com), the developer of [*Gunpoint*](http://www.gunpointgame.com/). It is a calm, well-structured introduction to building a videogame from scratch in a proprietary-yet-powerful coding language. By the end of the series, I understood a lot more about conditional logic, dependencies, trigonometry and debugging, amongst lots of other things. After the tutorial series finished I began adding features, tweaks and new aesthetics tentatively, slowly puzzling out each technique as I went.

###Tools Used

  * [Gamemaker: Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio)
  * [bfxr.net](http://bfxr.net)
  * MS Paint

###License
This game was a means to an end. I improved my coding abilities, and in the end had something to show people for it. As such, I have no desire to license it or restrict its use or dissection in any way, shape or form; please do whatever you want with it. If you own **Gamemaker: Studio**, you can open the `.gmx` project file and play around with the code directly; I have commented it fairly rigourously. 

For more details, see the [`License.MD`](https://github.com/bonfiredog/saucerberks/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file in the repository.

###System Requirements
I'm fairly certain that the game should run on any Windows PC or Mac built in the last five or six years. However, if you have any performance problems, please see the *Bugs* section below.

###Bugs
If you experience any issues of performances, crashes, odd behaviour or the like, *please* do send me a bug report [via email](mailto:admin@bonfiredog.co.uk) with as much detail as you can manage. It really helps.

###Contact
